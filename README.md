# Quiz Assignment!

#### Our assignment was to create a quiz dynamically through javascript. The acceptance criteria for the quiz is below:

* GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
* WHEN I click the start button
* THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
* WHEN I answer a question
* THEN I am presented with another question
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
* THEN time is subtracted from the clock
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
* THEN the game is over
* WHEN the game is over
* THEN I can save my initials and my score

#### My quiz contains:
* 15 multiple choice questions (answer key at the bottom of this file)
    * If you are correct, you can move on to the next question
    * If you are not correct, ten seconds will be taken from the timer.
* A timer set to start at 120 seconds. 
* A scoreboard at the end where a user can choose to save their score, or play again.
* A separate window that shows the top scores in order of highest score.
